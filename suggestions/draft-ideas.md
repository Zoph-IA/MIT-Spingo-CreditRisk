# DRAFT IDEAS

This document proposes an initial structure for the `MIT-Spingo-CreditRisk` repository, focused on credit risk analysis and customer payment behavior.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Analyze the variables that influence credit approval.
- Assess the payment behavior of clients with approved loans.
- Develop predictive models to estimate credit risk.
- Segment customers based on their risk profile and payment behavior.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
- Version Control: Git
- Hosting Platform: GitHub

## 📌 Additional Notes

- Ensure data anonymization to protect customer privacy.
- Document each analysis step to facilitate reproducibility.
- Consider implementing unit tests for scripts in the `src/` directory.
